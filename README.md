Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that often goes undetected until advanced stages. Early prediction using clinical attributes can significantly improve patient outcomes.  This project builds and evaluates multiple ML models to predict CKD at an early stage, achieving 94% accuracy.
